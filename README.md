A Simple REST Client Example

 The service used is http://www.mediafire.com/. 
 Before starting, you need to create an account at the service, do this using password authentication.
 Once logged in, click on your user logo and select Account settings then select Developers and create a new application. You will need the App ID and API Key to make API calls
 
 You need to make two API calls. The first one will log you in to the mediafire service.
 Information returned by that call will be used in the next call to get user info
